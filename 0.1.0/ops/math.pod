=head1 DESCRIPTION

Operations that perform some sort of mathematics, including both basic
math and transcendental functions.


=cut

=head2 Arithmetic operations

These operations store the results of arithmetic on other registers and
constants into their destination register, $1.

=over 4

=item B<abs>(inout INT)

=item B<abs>(inout NUM)

=item B<abs>(out INT, in INT)

=item B<abs>(out INT, in NUM)

=item B<abs>(out NUM, in INT)

=item B<add>(inout NUM, in INT)

=item B<add>(inout NUM, in NUM)

=item B<add>(in PMC, in INT)

=item B<add>(in PMC, in NUM)

=item B<add>(in PMC, in PMC)

Increase $1 by the amount in $2.

=item B<add>(out INT, in INT, in INT)

=item B<add>(out NUM, in NUM, in INT)

=item B<add>(out NUM, in NUM, in NUM)

=item B<add>(in PMC, in PMC, in INT)

=cut

=item B<cmod>(out INT, in INT, in INT)

NOTE: This "uncorrected mod" algorithm uses the C language's built-in
mod operator (x % y), which is

    ... the remainder when x is divided by y, and thus is zero
    when y divides x exactly.
    ...
    The direction of truncation for / and the sign of the result
    for % are machine-dependent for negative operands, as is the
    action taken on overflow or underflow.
                                                     -- [1], page 41

Also:

    ... if the second operand is 0, the result is undefined.
    Otherwise, it is always true that (a/b)*b + a%b is equal to z. If
    both operands are non-negative, then the remainder is non-
    negative and smaller than the divisor; if not, it is guaranteed
    only that the absolute value of the remainder is smaller than
    the absolute value of the divisor.
                                                     -- [1], page 205

This op is provided for those who need it (such as speed-sensitive
applications with heavy use of mod, but using it only with positive
arguments), but a more mathematically useful mod based on ** floor(x/y)
and defined with y == 0 is provided by the mod op.

=cut

=item B<cmod>(in PMC, in PMC, in PMC)

=item B<cmod>(in PMC, in PMC, in INT)

=item B<cmod>(in PMC, in PMC, in NUM)


=cut

=item B<cmod>(out NUM, in NUM, in NUM)

NOTE: This "uncorrected mod" algorithm uses the built-in C math library's
fmod() function, which computes

    ... the remainder of dividing x by y. The return value is
    x - n * y, where n is the quotient of x / y, rounded towards
    zero to an integer.
                                -- fmod() manpage on RedHat Linux 7.0

In addition, fmod() returns

    the remainder, unless y is zero, when the function fails and
    errno is set.

According to page 251 of [1], the result when y is zero is implementation-
defined.

This op is provided for those who need it, but a more mathematically
useful numeric mod based on floor(x/y) instead of truncate(x/y) and
defined with y == 0 is provided by the mod op.

=item B<mod>(out INT, in INT, in INT)

NOTE: This "corrected mod" algorithm is based on the C code on page 70
of [1]. Assuming correct behavior of the built-in mod operator (%) with
positive arguments, this algorithm implements a mathematically convenient
version of mod, defined thus:

  x mod y = x - y * floor(x / y)

For more information on this definition of mod, see section 3.4 of [2],
pages 81-85.
