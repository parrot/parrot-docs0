=head1 NAME

cmp.ops - Register Comparison Ops


=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Operations that compare two registers against each other.
Some of these operations affect control flow directly; others
do not.


=cut

=head2 Flow control comparison operators

These operators branch based on the relationship between
their operands.

=item B<eq_num>(in PMC, in PMC, inconst INT)

=item B<eq_addr>(in STR, in STR, inconst INT)

=item B<eq_addr>(in PMC, in PMC, inconst INT)

Branch if $1 is equal to $2. For PMCs this does a generic comparison,
whatever that is for the involved PMCs. Mixed PMC number/string
operands do a numeric or string comparison respectively.

B<eq_str> and B<eq_num> enforce string or number comparisons.

B<eq_addr> compares the address of the objects or strings.


=cut

=item B<isnull>(in PMC, inconst INT)

Branch to $2 if $1 is a NULL PMC.

=item B<ne_num>(in PMC, in PMC, inconst INT)

=item B<ne_addr>(in STR, in STR, inconst INT)

=item B<ne_addr>(in PMC, in PMC, inconst INT)

=item B<le_str>(in PMC, in PMC, inconst INT)

=item B<le_num>(in PMC, in PMC, inconst INT)

=cut

=item B<and>(out INT, in INT, in INT)

=item B<and>(in PMC, in PMC, in PMC)

Short-circuiting logical and.  Returns $2 if it's false, else returns $3.

=item B<not>(in PMC, in PMC)

Set the boolean state of $1 to the opposite of the boolean state from $2.
